## Thanks


To you, for using the library, for helping me to make it faster and better, for learn with it and for releasing your

## Warning

English included in both this document and the code can be devastating for the brain of an average human being. Even so
we, the poor developers, are working hard to write as correctly as possible and learn along the way. The documentation
will be updated as we improve our language proficency as well as we receive critical / suggestions for this.
