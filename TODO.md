# Remaining thigs to do 

Well, yep, things to do

# Selection operators

* Implement the selection proportional to the individual position.

# Diversity

* Entropy (See _Adaptation to Changing Environments by Means of the Memory Based Thermodynamic Genetic Algorithm_, Mori N. et. al.).
* Pair-wise Hamming distance
* Moment of inertia based (_Measurement of Population Diversity_, Ronald W. Morrison and Kenneth A. De Jong).
# Grammars

* In grammars, terms like ZeroOrMore, OneToN and so, may be more useful if the
number of returned elements depends on a random distribution specified at
initialization time.
